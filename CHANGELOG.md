## Unreleased

### Feat

- ``HouseGradedSkillExtractRanking``: graded-relevance skill-extraction ranking
  task on the HOUSE subset of CAREER, re-annotated against the full ESCO v1.1.0
  taxonomy with a 0-4 score scale (HF: ``TechWolf/Skill-extraction-House-graded``,
  BEIR layout, validation split only).
- ``TechGradedSkillExtractRanking``: graded-relevance skill-extraction ranking
  task on the TECH subset of CAREER, re-annotated against the full ESCO v1.1.0
  taxonomy with a 0-4 score scale (HF: ``TechWolf/Skill-extraction-Tech-graded``,
  BEIR layout, validation split only).
- ``SkillSkapeGradedSkillExtractRanking``: graded-relevance skill-extraction
  ranking task on SkillSkape, re-annotated against the full ESCO v1.1.0 taxonomy
  with a 0-4 score scale (HF: ``TechWolf/Skill-extraction-SkillSkape-graded``,
  BEIR layout, validation split only).
- ``ESCOGradedSkillNormRanking``: graded-relevance skill-normalization ranking
  task that maps surface skill terms (ESCO alt-labels) to canonical ESCO skills,
  annotated against the full ESCO v1.1.0 taxonomy with a 0-4 score scale
  (HF: ``TechWolf/Skill-normalisation-ESCO-graded``, BEIR layout, validation
  split only).
- graded relevance support for ranking metrics: ``RankingDataset`` accepts an
  optional ``target_relevance`` field aligned 1-to-1 with ``target_indices``.
  ``ndcg@k`` uses a (2^rel - 1) gain when graded labels are provided; binary
  metrics (``map``, ``mrr``, ``recall@k``, ``hit@k``, ``rp@k``) ignore the
  field. Binary nDCG behavior is preserved when ``target_relevance`` is
  ``None``. See ``examples/custom_task_graded_relevance_example.py``.
- ``RankingTask.binary_relevance_threshold`` (default ``1e-9``) lets a graded
  task choose which grades count as positives for binary metrics. Items with
  relevance below the threshold are dropped from the binary positive set but
  still contribute to graded metrics like ``ndcg@k``. Has no effect when
  ``target_relevance`` is ``None``.

## v0.5.1 (2026-03-13)

### Feat

- NDCG metrics for paper
- enable row with dataset counts for results table example
- latex table results reporting for paper example
- ConteXTMatch query batching for out-of-memory on large ranking tasks
- make ESCO language support version dependent
- deduplication strategy for queries and targets to enable datasets with duplicate targets

### Fix

- latex table result set best results in bold for different model groups
- cast prediction matrices explicitly to float
- update dataset_ids in Task based on filtering non-supported ones
- linter fixes
- DatasetConfigNotSupported exceptions are introduced and skipped to solve dynamic dataset loading that can result in 0-length query or target tasks.
- default resolve duplicates in ranking and query

## v0.5.0 (2026-03-09)

### Refactor

- align task groups to paper (JOBSIM/SKILLSIM → Semantic Similarity + Candidate Ranking) (#45)

## v0.4.0 (2026-03-04)

### BREAKING CHANGE

- MetricsResult.language replaced by input_languages/output_languages

### Feat

- add lazy execution filtering and ExecutionMode enum
- add cross-lingual aggregation modes for per-language metrics
- freelancer project ranking
- add unicode normalization to lexical baseline preprocessing
- add lexical baselines for ranking

### Fix

- remove from example the dataset that uses ESCO 1.0.5 but defines UK as supported language
- add language field to MetricsResult for proper per-language aggregation
- solve issues in example files
- include lowercase setting in lexical baseline model names
- import SkillSkape

### Refactor

- use language-grouped averaging in per-task aggregation
- migrate freelancer task to dataset_id-based language mapping
- make language_aggregation_mode a non-optional parameter in evaluate()
- migrate freelancer project matching tasks to load_dataset API
- rename language_results to datasetid_results for consistency with dataset_id abstraction
- generalize dataset indexing from language-based to dataset_id-based

## v0.3.0 (2026-01-09)

### Feat

- SkillSkape dataset as ranking task
- Job title similarity as a ranking task

### Refactor

- move functions centered in run.py for public api to registry.py and results.py.
- rename evaluate.py to run.py to remove ambiguity with workrb.evaluate function

## v0.2.1 (2026-01-06)

### Fix

- README updated with ContextMatch and CurriculumMatchModel. CurriculumMatchModel added to pkg imports.

## v0.2.0 (2026-01-06)

### Feat

- **Context-Match**: Contribution of ConTeXTMatch model
- **skill-encoder**: curriculum skill encoder model for skill extraction tasks, following the work: https://ceur-ws.org/Vol-4046/ (paper 5)

### Fix

- usage example fixed
- wrong order attributes evaluate call in evaluate_multiple_models function (#17)

## v0.1.0 (2025-11-11)

### Fix

- first version 0.1.0 for release
