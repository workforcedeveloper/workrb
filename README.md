## Usage Guide

This section covers common usage patterns. Table of Contents:
- [Custom Tasks & Models](#custom-tasks--models)
- [Checkpointing & Resuming](#checkpointing--resuming)
- [Results & Aggregation](#results--aggregation)
- [Running Multiple Models](#running-multiple-models)


### Custom Tasks & Models

Add your custom task or model by (1) inheriting from a predefined base class and implementing the abstract methods, and (2) adding it to the registry: 
- **Custom Tasks**: Inherit from `RankingTask`, `MultilabelClassificationTask`,... Implement the abstract methods. Register via `@register_task()`.
- **Custom models**: Inherit from `ModelInterface`. Implement the abstract methods. Register via `@register_model()`.

```python
from workrb.tasks.abstract.ranking_base import RankingTask
from workrb.models.base import ModelInterface
from workrb.registry import register_task, register_model

@register_task()
class MyCustomTask(RankingTask):
    name: str = "MyCustomTask"
    ...


@register_model()
class MyCustomModel(ModelInterface):
    name: str = "MyCustomModel"
    ...

# Use your custom model and task:
model_results = workrb.evaluate(MyCustomModel(),[MyCustomTask()])
```

**For detailed examples**, see:
- [examples/custom_task_example.py](examples/custom_task_example.py) for a complete custom task implementation
- [examples/custom_model_example.py](examples/custom_model_example.py) for a complete custom model implementation

Feel free to make a PR to add your models & tasks to the official package! See [CONTRIBUTING guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md) for details.

### Checkpointing & Resuming

WorkRB automatically saves result checkpoints after each dataset evaluation within a task.

**Automatic Resuming** - Simply rerun with the same `output_folder`:

```python
# Run 1: Gets interrupted after 2 tasks
tasks = [
    workrb.tasks.ESCOJob2SkillRanking(
        split="val", 
        languages=["en"],
    )
]

results = workrb.evaluate(model, tasks, output_folder="results/my_model")

# Run 2: Automatically resumes from checkpoint
results = workrb.evaluate(model, tasks, output_folder="results/my_model")
# ✓ Skips completed tasks, continues from where it left off
```
**Extending Benchmarks** - Want to extend your results with additional tasks or languages? Add the new tasks or languages when resuming:

```python
# Resume from previous & extend with new task and languages
tasks_extended = [
    workrb.tasks.ESCOJob2SkillRanking(  # Add de, fr
        split="val",
        languages=["en", "de", "fr"],
    ),
    workrb.tasks.ESCOSkillNormRanking(  # Add new task
        split="val",
        languages=["en"],
    ),
]
results = workrb.evaluate(model, tasks_extended, output_folder="results/my_model")
# ✓ Reuses English results, only evaluates new languages/tasks
```

❌**You cannot reduce scope** when resuming. This is by design to avoid ambiguity. Finished tasks in the checkpoint should also be included in your WorkRB initialization. If you want to start fresh in the same output folder, use `force_restart=True`:
```python
results = workrb.evaluate(model, tasks, output_folder="results/my_model", force_restart=True)
```


### Results & Metric Aggregation

**Results** are automatically saved to your `output_folder`:

```
results/my_model/
├── checkpoint.json       # Incremental checkpoint (for resuming)
├── results.json          # Final results dump
└── config.yaml           # Final benchmark configuration dump
```

If you pass `save_rankings=True` to `evaluate`, WorkRB also writes per-task,
per-dataset ranking score artifacts under a model-scoped subdirectory:

```
results/my_model/
└── rankings/
    └── <model_name>/
        └── <task_name>__<dataset_id>.json
```

Each JSON file has two top-level keys:

- `header`: identifies the artifact and pins it to a specific dataset
  shape. Includes `schema_version`, `workrb_version`, `model_name`,
  `task_name`, `dataset_id`, `split`, `num_queries`, `num_targets`,
  plus four canary strings (`first_query_text`, `last_query_text`,
  `first_target_text`, `last_target_text`) used to detect silent dataset
  drift on replay.
- `scores`: a `{query_index: {target_index: score}}` mapping, with
  keys as positional indices into the live dataset's `query_texts` /
  `target_space` (stringified, as JSON requires string keys). Every
  `(query, target)` cell is stored. Non-finite values (`NaN`, `+inf`, `-inf`) are
  rejected at write time.

Once written, you can recompute metrics without rerunning the model by
pointing `evaluate_rankings` at the model-scoped directory:

```python
results = workrb.evaluate_rankings(
    rankings_dir="results/my_model/rankings/my_model",
    tasks=tasks,
    output_folder="results/my_model_replay",
)
```

This is the recommended way to re-score after a metric definition has
changed (e.g. a new ranking metric is added in a workrb release): replay
is cheap, the model never runs again, and `validate_header` rejects any
artifact whose dataset shape no longer matches the live one. A
`workrb_version` mismatch only logs a warning; an unknown
`schema_version` is a hard reject.

To load & parse results from a run:

```python
results = workrb.load_results("results/my_model/results.json")
print(results)
```

#### Aggregation Chain

The final benchmark score `mean_benchmark/<metric>/mean` is computed via the following chain:
`dataset`  → `language`  → `task` → `task_group` → `task_type`.
This enables sequential macro-averaging in each of the stages:
- `dataset`: Is the individual unit to start aggregation from. Each task contains a set of datasets, each with a unique `dataset_id`. *Example: The MELO task language/region subsets `usa_q_en_c_en` and `swe_q_sv_c_en`.*
- `language`: Aggregate over languages within the task's datasets. *Example: Group all monolingual French datasets in ESCOSkill2JobRanking*
- `task`: Aggregate over tasks in the same task group. *Example: HouseSkillExtractRanking and TechSkillExtractRanking tasks in the Skill Extraction task group.*
- `task_group`: Aggregate over task groups under a specific task type. *Example: Skill Extraction, Skill Normalization, and Job Normalization task groups, are all part of the ranking task type*
- `task_type`: Aggregate over different task types for final benchmark performance, e.g. the Ranking and Classification task types.

Per-language performance is available under language-grouped modes: `mean_per_language/<lang>/<metric>/mean`.
Each aggregation provides 95% confidence intervals (replace `mean` with `ci_margin`).

#### Available Metrics

**Ranking metrics** (used in `RankingTask`):

| Metric | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `map` | Mean Average Precision |
| `mrr` | Mean Reciprocal Rank |
| `ndcg@k` | Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain with support for top-k cutoff. Uses the standard TREC / Järvelin-Kekäläinen `(2^rel - 1)` exponential gain when the dataset provides graded `target_relevance`, otherwise every positive is treated as grade 1. See [Graded relevance](#graded-relevance-optional) for the `binary_relevance_threshold` interaction. |
| `recall@k` | Recall at k (e.g. `recall@5`, `recall@10`) |
| `hit@k` | Hit rate at k (binary): is any relevant item in the top-k? |
| `rp@k` | R-Precision at k: precision relative to total relevant items |

##### Graded relevance (optional)

`RankingDataset` accepts an optional `target_relevance` aligned 1-to-1 with `target_indices`. When set, `ndcg@k` consumes the grades via the standard `(2^rel - 1)` exponential gain (TREC / Järvelin-Kekäläinen convention, so numbers are comparable to mainstream IR literature). The other metrics (`map`, `mrr`, `recall@k`, `hit@k`, `rp@k`) remain binary, they decide what counts as a positive by thresholding the grades.

The grade scale is up to the task. A common convention, used throughout these docs and in the runnable example, is positive integers `{1, 2, 3}` for listed items, with `0` reserved for items not present in `target_indices` (implicitly unjudged / irrelevant). Continuous grades in `[0, 1]` and TREC-style `{0, 1, 2, 3, 4}` work equally well; values must be non-negative.

That threshold is `RankingTask.binary_relevance_threshold`. **It is the knob that decides what "relevant" means for the binary metrics on a graded dataset, so changing it changes their values.**

- Default `1e-9`: every listed grade > 0 is a positive, so a binary dataset (`target_relevance=None`) and a graded dataset where every listed item has grade > 0 produce the same binary metric values.
- Override on a graded task to express a stricter cutoff (e.g. `2.0` on a `{1, 2, 3}` scale: only secondary/primary count as positives; nice-to-haves still help nDCG but no longer count toward MAP).
- Has no effect when `target_relevance is None`.

The `recall@k` denominator on a graded dataset is the *thresholded* positive count, not the count of all listed items, so a graded dataset's binary numbers are not directly comparable to a fully-binary version of the same data. See [examples/custom_task_graded_relevance_example.py](examples/custom_task_graded_relevance_example.py) for a runnable side-by-side of how the threshold shifts MAP/MRR/recall while leaving nDCG unchanged.

**Classification metrics** (used in `ClassificationTask`):

| Metric | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `f1_macro`, `f1_micro`, `f1_weighted` | F1 score variants |
| `f1_samples` | Per-sample F1 (multilabel only) |
| `precision_macro`, `precision_micro`, `precision_weighted` | Precision variants |
| `recall_macro`, `recall_micro`, `recall_weighted` | Recall variants |
| `accuracy` | Overall accuracy (subset accuracy for multilabel) |
| `roc_auc`, `roc_auc_micro` | Area under ROC curve (threshold-independent) |

You can override the default metrics per task via the `metrics` parameter of `evaluate()`:

```python
results = workrb.evaluate(
    model, tasks, output_folder="results/my_model",
    metrics={"ESCOJob2SkillRanking": ["map", "mrr", "recall@5", "recall@10"]},
)
```

#### Language Aggregation Modes

The `language_aggregation_mode` parameter controls how dataset results are grouped during metric aggregation. There are 4 modes (`LanguageAggregationMode`):

| Mode | Behavior |
| --- | --- |
| `MONOLINGUAL_ONLY` (default) | Group by language; only include monolingual datasets (input lang == output lang). Cross-lingual datasets are filtered out. |
| `CROSSLINGUAL_GROUP_INPUT_LANGUAGES` | Group by the input/query language. Requires a single input language per dataset (skip multilingual inputs). |
| `CROSSLINGUAL_GROUP_OUTPUT_LANGUAGES` | Group by the output/target language. Requires a single output language per dataset (skip multilingual outputs). |
| `SKIP_LANGUAGE_AGGREGATION` | No language grouping or filtering. All datasets are directly macro-averaged per task. No per-language metrics are produced. |



#### Execution Mode
As `datasets` may be filtered out by the aggregation mode, you may want to skip evaluations that are not used in the final metrics. The `execution_mode` parameter controls whether incompatible datasets are evaluated:

| Mode | Behavior |
| --- | --- |
| `ExecutionMode.LAZY` (default) | Skip datasets that are incompatible with the chosen `language_aggregation_mode`, saving compute. |
| `ExecutionMode.ALL` | Evaluate all datasets regardless. Useful when you want to store all results and re-aggregate later with a different mode. |

> **Note:** Under `SKIP_LANGUAGE_AGGREGATION`, no datasets are ever incompatible, so `execution_mode` can be ignored.

An example of why you could choose for `ExecutionMode.ALL`:

```python
from workrb.types import LanguageAggregationMode, ExecutionMode

# Benchmark returns a detailed Pydantic model
results: BenchmarkResults = workrb.evaluate(
    model,
    tasks,
    language_aggregation_mode=LanguageAggregationMode.MONOLINGUAL_ONLY,
    execution_mode=ExecutionMode.ALL, # Execute all so we can later switch language_aggregation_mode
)
# No lazy mode was used; We can override the aggregation mode at summary time
summary = results.get_summary_metrics(
    language_aggregation_mode=LanguageAggregationMode.CROSSLINGUAL_GROUP_INPUT_LANGUAGES,
)
```

For a complete runnable example of different aggregation strategies, see [examples/run_benchmark_aggregation.py](examples/run_benchmark_aggregation.py).


### Running Multiple Models

Evaluate multiple models in a single call with `evaluate_multiple_models()`. Each model runs the `evaluate()` and automatically gets its own output folder (with checkpointing) based on the model name:

```python
results = workrb.evaluate_multiple_models(
    models=[model_a, model_b],
    tasks=tasks,
    output_folder_template="results/{model_name}", # Use explicit '{model_name}', used for templating
)
# results["model_a_name"] -> BenchmarkResults
# results["model_b_name"] -> BenchmarkResults
```

All keyword arguments from `evaluate()` (e.g. `language_aggregation_mode`, `execution_mode`) are passed through. See [examples/run_multiple_models.py](examples/run_multiple_models.py) for a complete example.
